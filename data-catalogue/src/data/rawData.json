From 2020 onwards figures relate to the median time taken by the appropriate response vehicle to respond to an incident. Calculations are based on the time taken to respond to each incident within a one month time period (August). This data refers to CAT1, CAT1(T) and CAT2 emergency responses, excluding Healthcare Professionals (HCP) calls.\nPrior to 2020, figures relate to the median i.e. midpoint value is reported rather than the simple average as it is unaffected by atypically long or short response times. \nThe median response time for response to incidents is calculated over the month of August as a sample of the calendar year. Measured in minutes and seconds. Data supplied by the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS). Data refers to Categories A, B & C emergency responses, excluding Healthcare Professional (HCP) calls. The median (i.e. the midpoint) is reported rather than the simple average as it is unaffected by atypically long or short response times (outliers).\nFurther analysis of this data for most and least deprived areas and also rural comparisons are available from the Department of Health, health inequalities statistics. Sub-regional inequality analysis are also available which includes analysis of inequality gaps within HSC Trust and LGD areas.

They are updated\neach year:\n\n  * in March, to include estimates by end-user and fuel type\n  * in June, to include estimates by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)\n\nThe statistics covers emissions that occur within the UK’s borders. When\nemissions are reported by source, emissions are attributed to the sector that\nemits them directly. When emissions are reported by end-user, energy supply\nemissions by source are reallocated in accordance with where the end-use\nactivity occurred. This reallocation of emissions is based on a modelling\nprocess. For example, all the carbon dioxide produced by a power station is\nallocated to the power station when reporting on a source basis. However, when\napplying the end-user method, these emissions are reallocated to the users of\nthis electricity, such as domestic homes or large industrial users.\n\nBEIS does not estimate emissions outside the UK associated with UK\nconsumption, however the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\npublishes estimates of the [UK’s carbon\nfootprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint)\nannually. The [alternative approaches to reporting UK greenhouse gas emissions\nreport](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-gas-\nemissions-explanatory-notes) outlines the differences between them.\n\nFor the purposes of reporting, greenhouse gas emissions are allocated into a\nsmall number of broad, high level sectors known as National Communication\nsectors, which are as follows: energy supply, business, transport, public,\nresidential, agriculture, industrial processes, land use land use change and\nforestry (LULUCF), and waste management.\n\nThese high-level sectors are made up of a number of more detailed sectors,\nwhich follow the definitions set out by the [International Panel on Climate\nChange (IPCC)](http://www.ipcc.ch/), and which are used in international\nreporting tables which are submitted to the [United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://unfccc.int/) every year. A\n[list of corresponding Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) used and a record of\nbase year emissions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-\ngas-emissions-explanatory-notes) are published separately.\n\nThis is a National Statistics publication and complies with the Code of\nPractice for Statistics.\n\nPlease check our [frequently asked\nquestions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-gas-\nemissions-statistics-user-guidance) or email\n[Climatechange.Statistics@beis.gov.uk](mailto:Climatechange.Statistics@beis.gov.uk)\nif you have any questions or comments about the information on this page.\n\n  *[SIC]: Standard Industrial Classification\n  *[LULUCF]: land use land use change and forestry\n  *[IPCC]: International Panel on Climate Change\n  *[UNFCCC]: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n  *[GWPs]: Global Warming Potentials\n\n"

            "value" : " \nWoodland is defined in UK forestry statistics as land under stands of trees with a\nminimum area of 0.5 hectares and a canopy cover of at least 20%, or having the\npotential to achieve this. The definition relates to land use, rather than land cover,\nso integral open space and felled areas that are awaiting restocking are included as\nwoodland. Further information, including how this UK definition compares with the\ninternational definition of woodland, is provided in the Sources chapter.\nStatistics on woodland area are used to inform government policy and resource\nallocation, to provide context to UK forestry and land management issues and are\nreported to international organisations. They are also used in the compilation of\nnatural capital accounts.\nIncreases in woodland area result from the creation of new woodland. This can be\nachieved through new planting or by natural colonisation of trees. Further\ninformation is available https://cdn.forestresearch.gov.uk/2022/09/Ch1_Woodland_2022.pdf\n    "

To find out what effect UK consumption has on GHG emissions we\n    need to take into account where the goods we buy come from and their associated\n    supply chains.\n    \n    \nSince 1997, the UK economy has continued to move from a manufacturing base towards\n    the services sector. One of the consequences of this is that more of the goods we buy\n    and use are now produced overseas. This statistical release breaks down emissions\n    into: those produced and consumed in the UK; those generated by households\n    directly through heating and motoring; and those emissions relating to imports either\n    from China, USA, Europe or the Rest of the World. It excludes emissions arising from\n    UK produced goods that are exported.\n    "

Estimates for earlier years are calculated from the original questions with an adjustment applied to make them comparable to the new questions. From April 2017, the upper age limit for the self-completion module was increased to ask all respondents aged 16 to 74. Figures for 16 to 59 year olds only are presented in this table to allow comparisons to be made over a longer time period. A small change to the weighting procedure was made in 2019. This change is being applied going forward and was incorporated into all historic datasets. The effect of this change will only have a negligible impact on the estimates in this table and therefore historic data have not been re-calculated using the new weights, except for the year ending March 2018, where direct comparisons were previously made to the year ending March 2019. Estimates for the year ending March 2005 could not be re-calculated due to a manual adjustment which was applied to make the data comparable with the year ending 2013 onwards. More information can be found in footnote 3.\tNo data is available for the year ending March 2008 because comparable questions on any domestic abuse, any partner abuse and any family abuse were not included in that year. The sample size is lower for the years ending March 2011, March 2012 and March 2013 than for other years due to use of a split-sample experiment in these years. The sample size is lower for the years ending March 2018 and March 2019 due to use of a split-sample experiment. The sum of the overarching domestic abuse categories is not the sum of the sub-categories as some victims may be included in multiple categories as they can experience more than one type of abuse. The bases given are for any domestic abuse except for year ending March 2008 which is for partner abuse (non-sexual); the bases for the other measures presented will be similar."

            "value" : "New questions were introduced into the survey from the year ending March 2013, and estimates from this year onwards are calculated using these new questions. Estimates for earlier years are calculated from the original questions with an adjustment applied to make them comparable to the new questions. From April 2017, the upper age limit for the self-completion module was increased to ask all respondents aged 16 to 74. Figures for 16 to 59 year olds only are presented in this table to allow comparisons to be made over a longer time period. A small change to the weighting procedure was made in 2019. This change is being applied going forward and was incorporated into all historic datasets. The effect of this change will only have a negligible impact on the estimates in this table and therefore historic data have not been re-calculated using the new weights, except for the year ending March 2018, where direct comparisons were previously made to the year ending March 2019. Estimates for the year ending March 2005 could not be re-calculated due to a manual adjustment which was applied to make the data comparable with the year ending 2013 onwards. More information can be found in footnote 3.\tNo data is available for the year ending March 2008 because comparable questions on any domestic abuse, any partner abuse and any family abuse were not included in that year. The sample size is lower for the years ending March 2011, March 2012 and March 2013 than for other years due to use of a split-sample experiment in these years. The sample size is lower for the years ending March 2018 and March 2019 due to use of a split-sample experiment. The sum of the overarching domestic abuse categories is not the sum of the sub-categories as some victims may be included in multiple categories as they can experience more than one type of abuse. The bases given are for any domestic abuse except for year ending March 2008 which is for partner abuse (non-sexual); the bases for the other measures presented will be similar."

Additionally, provisional emissions for carbon dioxide (CO2) only are allocated into broad fuel classifications as follows: gas, oil, coal, other solid fuels and non-fuel.\r\n\r\nThese territorial provisional emissions estimates are subject to revision when the final estimates are published; however, they provide an early indication of emissions in the most recent full calendar year.\r\n\r\nThis is a National Statistics publication and complies with the Code of Practice for Statistics. Please check our [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-statistics-user-guidance) or email [GreenhouseGas.Statistics@beis.gov.uk](mailto:GreenhouseGas.Statistics@beis.gov.uk) if you have any questions or comments about the information on this page.\r\n\r\n  - LULUCF: land use, land use change and forestry\r\n  - CO2: carbon dioxide\r\n\r\n"

Excludes alternative provision and independent schools.\n- Figures for 2022 are based on revised data.\n- Figures for Isles of Scilly and City of London are based on a single school in each local authority and therefore figures have been suppressed.\n- Users are advised to take care when interpreting writing and science teacher assessment measures and reading, writing and maths (combined) measures for West Sussex, particularly when making comparisons over time or between local authorities. This local authority has higher rates of missing teacher assessment in 2022 than other areas.

Excludes alternative provision and independent schools.\n\n### Coverage \n\nEngland (state-funded schools)\n\n#### Geography definition\n\nCounties and Unitary Authorities,\nRegions,\nNation (England)\n\n### Source\n\n - England: [Department for Education](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/key-stage-2-attainment/2021-22) \n\n\n### Source Notes and Caveats \n- All figures include LA maintained schools, academies and free schools. Excludes alternative provision and independent schools.\n- Figures for 2022 are based on revised data.\n- Figures for Isles of Scilly and City of London are based on a single school in each local authority and therefore figures have been suppressed.\n- Users are advised to take care when interpreting writing and science teacher assessment measures and reading, writing and maths (combined) measures for West Sussex, particularly when making comparisons over time or between local authorities. This local authority has higher rates of missing teacher assessment in 2022 than other areas. See [Key stage 2 attainment Methodology](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/key-stage-2-attainment).  \n\n\n\n### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format \nThis dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). \nFor example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. \nFor more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals)."

This is broken down by their UK region and partner countries.\nRegional comparisons: This data shows import or export data within a particular quarter or year for UK regions alongside the same data for the UK. This is based on three metrics; the number of importing or exporting businesses , the value of trade, and the average value per business.\n\nBusinesses can appear in more than one quarter and can trade with more than one destination. Therefore users should not add up across quarters or partner countries. \n\n1. Methodology for allocating businesses to UK regions\n\nAs a result of the HMRC RTS methodology consultation the way businesses are allocated to UK region and country has changed. The previous methodology allocated trade to a region based on where the headquarters of a business is located, supplemented by survey data to allow better allocation of multi-site businesses. \nThis survey data is out of date and HMRC decided to develop a new methodology.\nIn the current methodology the trade value of a multi-site business is allocated to different regions based on a proportion of their employees in each region (based on linked information from the Inter Departmental Business Register). \nData on the number of traders is shown in two different way in the RTS release tables:\nWhole Number Method (does not add up to UK total): A business will be counted as one in every region they have employees. This represents the actual count of businesses in any region. However, it will mean the sum of the business count for each region will be greater than that for the UK. \n\nProportion Method (adds up to UK total): A business will be counted as a fraction in each region they trade based on the proportion of their employees in each region. An individual business counts as one business in the UK. The sum of businesses (whole and fractions) gives the total business count for a region.\nThe data in this analysis uses both methods. Please refer to the correct output for each methodology and flow.\n\n2. The number of businesses importing or exporting\n\nBusiness counts are a count of all VAT Registered businesses exporting and importing. \nAside from the EU/non-EU split (published as part of the RTS) there is no disaggregation of businesses not required to submit full EU declarations (below threshold traders) by EU partner country. The supplementary analysis provided here does split the number of businesses by EU partner country but these do not include the below threshold traders.\n\nExclusions\nThis dataset excludes businesses that cannot be allocated to a region due to lack of information about the business (unallocated - unknown). It does include businesses where details are known, but cannot be allocated due to the type of business (unallocated - known).  Further information can be found in the \n\nRTS Methodology paper.\n\nThis analysis also excludes 'unallocated - unknown' in the UK value totals, in order to make ratios (exports per exporter) and comparisons valid. Where information is known about a business but it is not possible to allocate to a specific region it is classed as 'unallocated - known'. These 'unallocated - known' businesses are included in both the value and count for UK totals.\nRTS data excludes trade in non-monetary gold, whereas HMRC OTS data does include this from 2005 onwards. RTS data also excludes non-response estimates. Therefore, it matches the 'total reported trade' figures in the OTS with the exception of non-monetary gold. More information can be found in section 3.20 of the RTS Methodology Paper.\n\nSuppressions\nA very small number of cells in the Business Counts tab have been suppressed under our statistical disclosure policy. These are shown a ‘S’ under the business count. Due to a review of disclosure, some data previously suppressed under the output produce by Department for International Trade (Exports proportion method only) may now be shown.\nFurther information on trade in goods by UK region\nHMRC publish quarterly data on trade by UK region in Regional Trade in Goods Statistics. This includes information on the number of exporters to the EU and Non-EU.\nhttps://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/RTS/Pages/default.aspx\n\nDetail on trade value by UK region, trade partner and commodity is available in Build Your Own Tables:\nhttps://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/BuildYourOwnTables/Pages/Home.aspx\n\n2020 data is provisional and subject to update.\n"

One individual is one payslip in a particular month if they work at least 1 hour in that month. The sample of small businesses is restricted based on the employment size band and erroneous payslips or those identified for non-wage purposes are excluded. Growth in small business jobs is calculated using the weighted average of within-firm year-on-year growth in jobs. As such, this accounts for any change in subscriber base and firms which shutdown entirely due to the pandemic.\nSales are measured based on the face value of invoices issued by firms within each month. Subscriber base changes are accounted for by measuring sales growth in one specific month using the sample of firms which also operated in the previous year."

Originally introduced for navigational safety, AIS data can also be used as a source of information for monitoring trends in shipping activity.\nWe collect and aggregate these messages to identify the number of ships that travel within a port bounding box and remain there for a series of transmissions, before travelling outside of the boundary again. The AIS messages also allow us to identify a subset of all ships as cargo and tanker ships.\nThis dataset provides the number of daily visits for 16 of the UK's most significant freight ports by tonnage, and a sum of those visits as a UK total. The UK total is seasonally adjusted using the seasonal adjustment method TRAMO-SEATS modified to deal with higher frequency time series."
